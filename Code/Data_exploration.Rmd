This document will be used for the data exploration phase of this project.  The first thing that I am going to do is upload the usual code to set up the workspace.

```{r}
# clear R's environment
rm(list = ls())

# upload the libraries that we will need for this analysis
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
```
