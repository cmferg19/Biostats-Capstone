This metadata file outlines the parameters of the data within the dataset that I am using for the 
Capstone project.  The data that I am using comes from the paper "Evaluation of a Powered Ankle-Foot 
Prosthesis during Slope Ascent Gait" by investigators Christopher A. Rabago, Jennifer Aldrige Whitehead,
and Jason M. Wilken to analyse the perfomance of different types of prosthetic limbs.  The goal of the 
research is to identify a prosthetic that will limit the strain of impact on the limb and reduce
compensation forces required to move and remain balanced on the prosthesis.
