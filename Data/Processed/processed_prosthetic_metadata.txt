This metadata file outlines the parameters of the processed data from the paper "Evaluation of a Powered Ankle-Foot 
Prosthesis during Slope Ascent Gait" by investigators Christopher A. Rabago, Jennifer Aldrige Whitehead,
and Jason M. Wilken. The processed data has taken the key variables that I am interested in analysing from the original 
data to investigate how different prosthetics impact long term health outcomes in amputees.

Description of the columns:
Subject - The number assigned to participants involved in the study
Session - the type of prosthetic being used, the options are BiOM (active) and ESR (passive)
Side - The leg being studied so either the intact leg or the prosthetic leg
Slope - The degree of the surface the study participants are walking up
Power_Gen_Pre - The power generated in the pre swing phase of the gait (J/Kg)
Power_Gen_Mid - The power generated in the midswing phase of the gait (J/Kg)
Power_Gen_Terminal - The power generated in the terminal phase of the gait (J/Kg)
Propulsion - The amount of propulsion generated (J/kg)
Braking - Also refered to as dampening, the amount of energy absorbed by the leg (J/Kg)
Velocity - The speed of walking (m/s)
